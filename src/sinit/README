sinit - suckless init
=====================

sinit is a simple init.  It was initially based on
Rich Felker's minimal init[1].

Why?
----

I wanted to get rid of Busybox init on my toy distro[2].

How?
----

There are 3 signals that sinit will act on.

      SIGUSR1: powers off the machine.
      SIGINT:  reboots the machine (or alternatively via ctrl-alt-del).
      SIGCHLD: reap children

To see how sinit integrates with the init scripts, then have
a look at [3].

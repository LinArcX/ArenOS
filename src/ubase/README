ubase - suckless linux base utils
=================================

ubase is  a collection of  tools similar  in spirit to  util-linux but
much simpler.

The complement  of ubase  is sbase[1] which  mostly follows  POSIX and
provides all the portable tools.  Together they are intended to form a
base system similar to busybox but much smaller and suckless.

Building
--------

To  build ubase,  simply  type  make.  You  may  have  to fiddle  with
config.mk and config.h depending on your system.

You  can  also  build  ubase-box,  which  generates  a  single  binary
containing  all  the  required  tools.    You  can  then  symlink  the
individual tools to ubase-box or run: make ubase-box-install.

To run the tools for ubase-box directly use: ubase-box cmd [args]

Ideally you will  want to statically link ubase.   We highly recommend
using musl-libc[2].

ubase is known to compile with gcc, clang and tcc.

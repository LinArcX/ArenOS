Package manager are evil. you may ask:
> why? They make our life easier!

There are some reasons for that:
- Abstractions are not evil. But they are not Agnels also!
- You need a bare minimum level of abstractions in the computer.
- By adding more abstractions, you will be more far away from the reallity.
- You should be very careful to adding layers of abstractions to your system.
- KISS and minimalism makes your life easier by removing extra abstractions.

- The best system is the system:
  - With less abstractions.
  - That you understand it very well.
    - if you understand a system very well, you can customize/change it better.
  - That give you the highest level of control.

- Package managers add more abstractions.
  - This abstractions encourages you to be carefree(and lazy after a while) and trust more easily. (since someone else made a repo with tons of ready-to-use package. i need to just run: `sudo apt install evil`)

Q: What will happen if i don't use a package manager?
A: Since there is no central place for grabbing package(repositories) or there is no package manger to use:
  - You will just add the packages that you `truly` need. (because it's costly and time consuming)
    - in this way, it's harder to make your system bloat(or: it's easier to keep your system lean/fast/understandable.)
  - You will force to think more carefully.
  - You need to to write your own scripts to automate your digital life as you wish.
    - You have full control/understanding on your scripts.
  - You need to visit real software websites and read their docs how to compile/use their applications.
    - In the long run, you will understand your packages better.

The idea behind ArenOS is to give you the opportunity to have maximum control over your system. 
Instead of someone else creating repository of packages, you can do all the steps by yourself.
For sure you can still automate this process by writing your own scripts.
